# Osmind Changes

I put the search field at the bottom of the "Your Notes" section for simple searching. I initially put the search field in the Navbar, as I think it would be a better user experience - and can initiate search from anywhere in the app. I chose not to as it would have been a much more involved undertaking and some extensive refactoring that isn't worth it for this assignment.

The app and new features mobile friendly and fully responsive.

Technically, there are a few changes I would have made. Specifically, I would have used a css preprocessor like Sass, and I would have used scss modules to prevent class name collision. Since these features were straightforward, I did everything in Home.js. But if I were building this out more fully, I likely would have broken down some of the new functionality into their own components.
